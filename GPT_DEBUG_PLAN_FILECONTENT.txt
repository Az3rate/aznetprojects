# GPT Debug Plan: File Path Resolution in getFileContent

## Issue
- When running commands like `cat src/App.tsx` from the root or a subdirectory, the file path is sometimes incorrectly resolved (e.g., `src/src/App.tsx` instead of `src/App.tsx`).
- This results in file not found errors and incorrect file lookups.

## What Was Tried
- The getFileContent method was updated to resolve paths as follows:
  - If the path starts with `/`, treat as absolute (remove leading `/`).
  - If the path contains `/`, treat as relative from the current directory.
  - Otherwise, treat as a file in the current directory.
- This fixed some issues, but we want to ensure all edge cases are handled and the logic is robust.

## What I Need From GPT
- Review the getFileContent method in src/services/fileSystem.ts.
- Suggest improvements or corrections to the file path resolution logic to ensure it matches real shell behavior:
  - `cat src/App.tsx` from `/` → `src/App.tsx`
  - `cat App.tsx` from `/src` → `src/App.tsx`
  - `cat ./App.tsx` from `/src` → `src/App.tsx`
  - `cat /src/App.tsx` from anywhere → `src/App.tsx`
- Ensure that relative and absolute paths are handled correctly, and that no double-directory issues occur.

## Context
- The relevant code is in src/services/fileSystem.ts.
- The method to review is getFileContent.

# Please review src/services/fileSystem.ts and provide code updates or suggestions to fix the file path resolution issue.
