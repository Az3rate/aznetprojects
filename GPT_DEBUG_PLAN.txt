# DEBUG PLAN for Swirl Background Layering Issue

## Issue
- The swirl background effect (SwirlBackground.tsx) is working, but it covers the terminal output and directory tree, making them invisible or inaccessible.

## What Was Tried
1. Updated the main swirl canvas (canvasBRef) to use:
   - `position: fixed`
   - `top: 0`, `left: 0`
   - `width: 100vw`, `height: 100vh`
   - `zIndex: 0`
   - `pointerEvents: none`
2. Ensured the background canvas is always rendered behind app content.
3. Advised to check that main app containers (terminal, sidebar, etc.) use `z-index: 1` or higher.
4. Confirmed that the canvas is still covering the content, so the issue is not resolved by these changes.

## Next Steps for GHPT
- Investigate why the terminal and directory tree are not visible above the swirl background.
- Check for stacking context or layout issues in the main app container(s).
- Suggest or implement a fix so the background stays behind all interactive content.

## File to Send for Debugging
- `src/components/Terminal/SwirlBackground.tsx` (contains the swirl background logic and styles)
