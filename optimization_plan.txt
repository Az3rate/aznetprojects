# Directory Provider and File Tree Optimization Plan

## âœ… Completed Optimizations

### FileExplorer Component Optimization
- Added useCallback for all functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Implemented proper loading states (loading, error, empty)
- Added debug logging for better traceability
- Improved dependency management
- Added proper TypeScript return types

## ðŸ”„ Current Issues

### 1. DirectoryProvider Optimization (Next Target)
- DirectoryProvider is mounting multiple times
- Each mount triggers a new file tree fetch
- No memoization of expensive operations
- Location: src/context/DirectoryContext.tsx

### 2. File Tree Loading
- Tree is fetched on every mount
- No caching mechanism
- Redundant fetches for the same data
- Location: src/context/DirectoryContext.tsx and src/services/fileSystem.ts

## Required Changes

### 1. DirectoryProvider Optimization (Next Priority)
Please provide code changes for:
1. Memoization implementation:
   - useMemo for convertGitHubTreeToFSNode
   - useCallback for event handlers
   - Memoization of fetchGitHubTree results

2. Loading state implementation:
   - Loading state context
   - Error state handling
   - Retry mechanism

3. Caching layer:
   - In-memory cache structure
   - Cache invalidation strategy
   - Cache persistence approach

### 2. File Tree Loading Optimization
Please provide code changes for:
1. Caching implementation:
   - GitHub API response cache
   - Converted file tree cache
   - Cache TTL and invalidation logic

2. Request handling:
   - Request queue implementation
   - Request deduplication
   - Request cancellation logic

3. Progressive loading:
   - Root structure loading
   - Subdirectory loading strategy
   - Loading indicators

## Required Format for Code Changes

For each change, please provide:

1. File path
2. Complete code block with changes
3. Explanation of changes
4. Dependencies or imports needed
5. Any potential side effects to consider

## Additional Context

Current file structure:
- src/context/DirectoryContext.tsx: Main context provider (Next target)
- src/services/fileSystem.ts: File system implementation
- src/components/Terminal/FileExplorer.tsx: File explorer component (âœ… Optimized)
- src/types/index.ts: Type definitions

Please provide code changes in a format that can be directly applied, with clear markers for:
- New code to add
- Code to modify
- Code to remove

Include any necessary type definitions or interface changes.

## Next Steps
1. Focus on DirectoryProvider optimization
2. Implement caching mechanism
3. Add proper loading states
4. Add error handling
5. Add retry mechanism
